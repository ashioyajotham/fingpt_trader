## Quick Start üö¶

1. **Environment Setup**
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configuration**
```bash
# Set up your .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit with your API keys and tokens:
# - BINANCE_API_KEY
# - BINANCE_SECRET_KEY
# - HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN
```

3. **Run Trading System**
```bash
# Development mode (testnet)
python main.py

# With specific pairs
python scripts/run_trader.py --pairs BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT
```

## Unique Features üí´

### 1. AI-Enhanced Market Analysis
```python
# Example of sentiment-adjusted trading signal
sentiment_score = await analyzer.get_sentiment(news_data)
market_signal = detector.analyze_inefficiencies(
    orderbook_data=depth,
    sentiment_weight=sentiment_score
)
```

### 2. Advanced Risk Management
- Dynamic VaR calculation
- Sentiment-adjusted position sizing
- Real-time drawdown monitoring

### 3. Tax-Aware Trading
- Automated tax-loss harvesting
- Wash sale prevention
- Tax efficiency optimization

## Mathematical Framework üìê

### Sentiment-Adjusted Market Inefficiency Detection

The system uses a composite signal model:

$$ S(t) = \alpha M(t) + \beta I(t) + \gamma L(t) $$

Where:
- $S(t)$ is the final trading signal
- $M(t)$ is market microstructure score
- $I(t)$ is orderbook imbalance
- $L(t)$ is NLP sentiment score
- $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are weights

### Order Book Imbalance

$$ I(t) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n V^b_i - \sum_{i=1}^n V^a_i}{\sum_{i=1}^n V^b_i + \sum_{i=1}^n V^a_i} $$

Where:
- $V^b_i$ is bid volume at level i
- $V^a_i$ is ask volume at level i
- $n$ is depth of orderbook

### Position Sizing with Kelly Criterion

Modified Kelly formula incorporating sentiment:

$$ f^* = \frac{p(1+r) - q}{r} \cdot (1 + \lambda|S|) $$

Where:
- $f^* is optimal fraction
- $p$ is win probability
- $q = 1-p$ is loss probability
- $r$ is win/loss ratio
- $S$ is sentiment score
- $\lambda$ is sentiment sensitivity

### Risk Management

Value at Risk with sentiment adjustment:

$$ VaR_{\alpha}(S) = -\inf\{l \in \mathbb{R}: P(L \leq l | S) \geq \alpha\} $$

Portfolio risk score:

$$ R = \sqrt{w^T\Sigma w} \cdot (1 + \delta|S|) $$

Where:
- $w$ is portfolio weights
- $\Sigma$ is covariance matrix
- $S$ is sentiment score
- $\delta$ is risk adjustment factor

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

Harvesting threshold with wash sale prevention:

$$ H(p, t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \frac{p_t - p_0}{p_0} < \tau \text{ and } t > T_{wash} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$

Where:
- $p_t$ is current price
- $p_0$ is entry price
- $\tau$ is loss threshold
- $T_{wash}$ is wash sale period
