# FinGPT Trader: Market Inefficiency Detection Using LLMs
An intelligent trading system combining FinGPT LLM for sentiment analysis with market inefficiency modeling.

## Key Features

1. **Sentiment Analysis Engine**
   - FinGPT-powered news processing
   - Real-time market sentiment scoring
   - Event impact prediction

2. **Market Inefficiency Detection**
   - Pairs trading opportunities
   - Statistical arbitrage signals
   - Order book imbalances
   - Volume profile analysis

3. **Risk Management**
   - Dynamic position sizing
   - Portfolio optimization
   - Real-time risk monitoring

## Market Inefficiencies

### 1. Statistical Arbitrage
- **Cointegration-Based Pairs Trading**
  ```python
  # Engle-Granger Two-Step Method
  def find_cointegrated_pairs(prices):
      # Step 1: Linear Regression
      β = (X'X)^(-1)X'Y
      
      # Step 2: Test for Stationarity
      spread = Y - βX
      ADF(spread) < critical_value
  ```

- **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process**
  ```python
  dXt = θ(μ - Xt)dt + σdWt
  # where:
  # θ = mean reversion rate
  # μ = long-term mean
  # σ = volatility
  # Wt = Wiener process
  ```

- **Order Book Imbalance (OBI)**
  ```python
  OBI = (BidSize - AskSize)/(BidSize + AskSize)
  ```

- **Price Impact (PI)**
  ```markdown
  PI = Σ(Vi × |Pi - VWAP|)/ΣVi
  ```

# i) The first is data mining.

A trading system based on data mining looks for patterns in past price data and fits a model to them.

The only assumption is that the patterns of the past will repeat in the future. This is where most people start throwing in machine learning.

***********************Few successful trading systems are built through data mining***************************


# ii) The second is modeling market inefficiencies.

Model-based systems start with a model of a market inefficiency.

Inefficiencies can be based on trader psychology, economics, market microstructure, company events, or anything else that affects the price.

These inefficiencies cause patterns that deviate from the normal randomness of the market.

Sometimes, these patterns repeat and can be detected, predicted, and traded.

*******************************Most successful algorithmic trading systems are built by modeling market inefficiencies*************************

An edge is a market anomaly that consistently, and non-randomly, makes you money.

Algorithmic trading is a constant cycle of hypothesis formation and testing. This is why you learned Minimum Viable Python. 
You need to cycle through ideas as fast as you can since most of them will not work.

## Service Architecture

   - OrderManager: Order lifecycle and position management
   - RoboAdvisorService: Automated portfolio management and recommendations

3. **Monitoring Services**
