## Technical Implementation

1. **FinGPT Integration**
   - Fine-tune FinGPT for financial sentiment analysis
   - Process real-time news and market data
   - Generate sentiment scores and market insights

2. **Market Inefficiency Detection**
   - Model market microstructure patterns
   - Analyze trader psychology indicators
   - Track company events and anomalies

3. **Trading Strategy**
   - Combine sentiment analysis with market inefficiency signals
   - Risk management and position sizing
   - Portfolio optimization

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run data preprocessing: `python scripts/data_preprocessing.py`
4. Train models: `python scripts/train_models.py`
5. Evaluate models: `python scripts/evaluate_models.py`
6. Start the trading bot: `python scripts/trading_bot.py`

# i) The first is data mining.

A trading system based on data mining looks for patterns in past price data and fits a model to them.

The only assumption is that the patterns of the past will repeat in the future. This is where most people start throwing in machine learning.

***********************Few successful trading systems are built through data mining***************************


# ii) The second is modeling market inefficiencies.

Model-based systems start with a model of a market inefficiency.

Inefficiencies can be based on trader psychology, economics, market microstructure, company events, or anything else that affects the price.

These inefficiencies cause patterns that deviate from the normal randomness of the market.

Sometimes, these patterns repeat and can be detected, predicted, and traded.

*******************************Most successful algorithmic trading systems are built by modeling market inefficiencies*************************

An edge is a market anomaly that consistently, and non-randomly, makes you money.

Algorithmic trading is a constant cycle of hypothesis formation and testing. This is why you learned Minimum Viable Python. 
You need to cycle through ideas as fast as you can since most of them will not work.

## Service Architecture

The system is built on a service-oriented architecture with the following core services:

1. **Data Feed Services**
   - MarketDataService: Real-time market data integration
   - NewsService: Multi-source news aggregation and preprocessing

2. **Trading Services**
   - BrokerService: Broker API integration and order execution
   - OrderManager: Order lifecycle and position management
   - RoboAdvisorService: Automated portfolio management and recommendations

3. **Monitoring Services**
   - SystemMonitor: System health and resource monitoring
   - PerformanceTracker: Trading performance analytics

## Implementation Details
