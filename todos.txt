1. Currently, the trading pairs come from the configuration files:
   - `trading.yaml` has the main list of symbols (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT)
   - `strategies.yaml` has pairs for inefficiency detection

2. The system doesn't actually take trading pairs directly from clients. Instead:
   - The main system trades the pre-configured pairs from trading.yaml
   - The robo-advisor component manages client portfolios using these same pairs
   - There's no current mechanism for clients to specify custom trading pairs

This could be improved by:
1. Adding client-specific trading pair configuration
2. Implementing validation for client-requested trading pairs
3. Adding dynamic pair management
4. Creating separate trading pair pools for system vs client trading

### FinGPT Trading System Analysis

#### Strengths üöÄ

1. **Architecture**
   - Clean modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Well-organized service-oriented architecture
   - Configurable components via YAML files

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Advanced NLP with FinGPT/Falcon-7b
   - Modern Python async support
   - Type hints usage (though incomplete)

3. **Risk Management**
   - Built-in position sizing
   - Stop-loss mechanisms
   - Portfolio monitoring

#### Weaknesses üîç

1. **Code Quality Issues**
```python
class FinGPT(BaseLLM):
    def __init__(self, config: Dict[str, Any]):
        # No type validation
        self.config = config  # Uses Any type extensively
        # No error handling for missing config
```

2. **Testing Gaps**
   - Limited unit test coverage
   - Missing integration tests
   - No backtesting framework validation

3. **Error Handling**
```python
async def fetch_data(self):
    try:
        data = await self._fetch()
        return data
    except Exception as e:
        # Too broad exception handling
        logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
        return None  # Silent failures
```

4. **Documentation**
   - Incomplete docstrings
   - Missing API documentation
   - Limited architecture documentation

5. **Performance Concerns**
   - Memory management for large models
   - No caching strategy for API calls
   - Potential bottlenecks in real-time processing

6. **Deployment**
   - No containerization
   - Missing deployment configurations
   - No CI/CD pipeline

7. **Model Management**
```python
# Hardcoded model paths
self.base_model = "tiiuae/falcon-7b"
# No model versioning
# No model performance tracking
```

8. **Resource Management**
   - No connection pooling
   - Missing rate limiting
   - No resource cleanup mechanisms

9. **Configuration**
   - No schema validation
   - Environment variables not properly handled
   - Missing production configurations

10. **Market Risk**
    - Limited market condition checks
    - No circuit breakers
    - Missing stress testing framework

For improvement, I'd suggest:
1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add configuration validation
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Add performance monitoring
6. Improve documentation

Would you like specific examples of any of these improvements?
