1. Currently, the trading pairs come from the configuration files:
   - `trading.yaml` has the main list of symbols (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT)
   - `strategies.yaml` has pairs for inefficiency detection

2. The system doesn't actually take trading pairs directly from clients. Instead:
   - The main system trades the pre-configured pairs from trading.yaml
   - The robo-advisor component manages client portfolios using these same pairs
   - There's no current mechanism for clients to specify custom trading pairs

This could be improved by:
1. Adding client-specific trading pair configuration
2. Implementing validation for client-requested trading pairs
3. Adding dynamic pair management
4. Creating separate trading pair pools for system vs client trading
